# At #7, we test that we're redirecting guests if they attempt to favorite a post.
#
# At #8, we expect that after a user favorites a post, we redirect them back to the post's show view. Notice that
# we can put an expect anywhere inside the it block. We've been placing them at the end of each it block, but that isn't
# the only place we can use them.
# #
# # At #9, we expect that no favorites exist for the user and post. Notice we can put  expect statements anywhere
# within an it block.
#
# At #10, we expect that after a user has favorited a post, they will have a favorite associated with that post.


# At #14, we test that we redirect guest users to sign in before allowing them to unfavorite a post.
#
# At #15, we test that when a user unfavorites a post, we redirect them to the post's show view.
#
# At #16, we expect that the user and post has an associated favorite that we can delete.
#
# At #17, we expect that the associated favorite is nil.
