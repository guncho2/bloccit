 <!-- #At #5, we format a link as an Edit button which directs a user to  /posts/@post.id/edit.
  edit_post_path(@post) is a helper method that is generated in routes.rb by resources :posts.
   (Run rails routes from the command line to view the post routes, if you need a refresher.) -->
<!-- At #9, we use link_to to create a delete button. The text on the button is Delete Post. We override the
default method (:post) with :delete so that when the button is pressed the route called is the delete route.
 We style the button by setting  class: to 'btn btn-danger'. We pass a Hash with the confirm: key to the data:
  argument. This confirms the action with a JavaScript confirmation dialog when a user presses the button. -->
